    "Fuzzy logic was developed in 1965 and since has had a lot of advancements. It has been used in various applications since its development, notably the high speed train in Japan, Sony mini-computers, image processing, automobile control systems, household machines etc. We have learn many classification algorithms in class and also observed in Assignment 3 that non-linear models tend to perform better for classification than the linear ones and hence, I believe due to non-linear behavior, fuzzy systems will perform better than the linear models if not the best. Thus, my basic objective is to determine how good fuzzy logic is on various data sets when compared to state-of-art methods like **Linear Discriminant Analysis** (LDA), **Linear Logistic Regression** (LR) & **Non-Linear Logistic Regression** (NLR).

    "Fuzzy logic is a form of many-valued logic in which the truth values of variables may be any real number between 0 and 1. By contrast, in Boolean logic, the truth values of variables may only be the integer values 0 or 1. Fuzzy logic has been employed to handle the concept of partial truth, where the truth value may range between completely true and completely false. Furthermore, when linguistic variables are used, these degrees may be managed by specific (membership) functions.\n",
    "\n",
    "Since the fuzzy system output is a consensus of all of the inputs and all of the rules, fuzzy logic systems can be well behaved when input values are not available or are not trustworthy. Weightings can be optionally added to each rule in the rulebase and weightings can be used to regulate the degree to which a rule affects the output values. These rule weightings can be based upon the priority, reliability or consistency of each rule. These rule weightings may be static or can be changed dynamically, even based upon the output from other rules.\n",
